Sample Drivetrains
==================

In this section, we compile several sample drivetrains which you can use as a starting point for your own designs. You should also check the :doc:`gallery of robot designs </docs/appendix/gallery>` in the Appendix.

`goBILDA strafer chassis <https://www.gobilda.com/strafer-chassis-kit-v4/>`_
   Basic mecanum chassis by goBILDA. Simple and easy to build chassis, providing an excellent starting point for robots built from goBILDA parts.
`goBILDA BeeLine Chassis <https://www.gobilda.com/beeline-chassis-kit/>`_
   Basic 6 wheel drive chassis by goBILDA. Simple and easy to build chassis, providing an excellent starting point for robots built from goBILDA parts.
`Strafer chassis with Dead Wheels <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R85u8nGGmBu5_6jIztOH3-5_W4XK08Mb/view?usp=drive_open>`_

`REV Robotics 6 wheel drivetrain <https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-build/channel-drivetrain-build-guide>`_
   Sample 6 wheel drivetrain built using REV kit.
`AndyMark Tile Runner chassis <https://www.andymark.com/products/tilerunner-options>`_
   A universal chassis kit sold by AndyMark. It is available in several modifications: 6 wheel, mecanum, tank tread. It is expensive, but using provided 3d models as inspiration for your own drivetrain is free.
`Wizards.exe 6 wheel drive chassis <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iu2UUNlqoQ6bS1vnoRPtUI0Uv3lLjNec/view?usp=drive_open>`_
   Another design by FTC 9794 Wizards.exe. Combines custom side panels with Actobotics parts (gears, chain sprockets).
`Custom drivetrain by FTC 14875 LightSpeed <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iu2UUNlqoQ6bS1vnoRPtUI0Uv3lLjNec/view?usp=drive_open>`_
   This design uses goBILDA mecanum wheels, motors, and some channels combined with custom side plates.
`NX VANTAGE-H <https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3d22333d5ba0abcc62edb57e/w/fa027f644666441544a378c6/e/693039a92658a00632996b28>`_
   Another custom drivetrain using goBILDA mecanum wheels, by redditor /u/nateless. Note that this design can be viewed but not downloaded---this is intentional; see his `original reddit post <https://www.reddit.com/r/FTC/comments/c8vlsj/cad_for_nx_vantageh_is_going_public/>`_.
