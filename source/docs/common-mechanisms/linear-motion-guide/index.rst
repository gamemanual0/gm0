Linear Motion Guide
===================

Linear motion is one of the most important components of a successful robot. In most games, teams are required to reach into an area that the drivetrain cannot access in order to pick up or deposit game elements. For example, in 2017-2018, Relic Recovery, teams needed to extend an arm of some sort to grab the Relic that was placed in the corner of the playing field. This area of the game field was nearly impossible for a robot to drive to, so a linear extension was necessary.

Access of > 18" is necessary for nearly all games; >24" is preferred. In some games, an extension of 36" or more may be needed.

.. note:: It is possible to achieve extension with an arm, but since this guide is geared toward newer teams, linear extensions should be prioritized over arms. Refer to the :doc:`Arm Guide </docs/common-mechanisms/arms>` for more information.
