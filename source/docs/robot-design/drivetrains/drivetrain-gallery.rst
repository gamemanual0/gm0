Sample Drivetrains
==================

In this section, we compile several sample drivetrains
which you can use as a starting point for your own designs.
You should also check :doc:`gallery of  robot designs <../../appendix/gallery>`
in the Appendix.

`goBILDA strafer chassis <https://www.gobilda.com/strafer-chassis-kit/>`_
    Basic chassis by goBILDA. Simple and easy to build chassis, providing
    an excellent starting point for robots built from goBILDA kit.
`Strafer chassis with odometry <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R85u8nGGmBu5_6jIztOH3-5_W4XK08Mb>`_
    Modification of goBILDA chassis by FTC 9794 Wizards.exe, which adds
    odometry wheels. See also their video tutorials:

`REV Robotics 6 wheel drivetrain <http://www.revrobotics.com/content/docs/GearDrivetrain-Guide.pdf>`_
    Sample 6 wheel drivetrain built using REV  kit.
`AndyMark Tile Runner chassis <https://www.andymark.com/products/tilerunner-options>`_
    A universal chassis kit sold by AndyMark. It is available in several
    modifications: 6 wheel, mecanum, tank tread. It is pricey, but using
    provided 3d models as inspiration for your own drvietrain is free.
`Basebot <http://basebot.co/>`_
    A customizable open source drivetrain by FTC 10355 Project Peacock.
    It was designed specifically to be used by other teams as a base
    of their robots.
`Wizards.exe 6 wheel drive chassis <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iu2UUNlqoQ6bS1vnoRPtUI0Uv3lLjNec>`_
    Another design by FTC 9794 Wizards.exe. Combines custom side panels with
    Actobotics parts (gears, chain sprockets).
`Custom drivetrain by FTC 14875 LightSpeed <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r1GoAeoGpUf4KAeKsTn6JuLm4QvmPZHS>`_
    This design uses goBILDA mecanum wheels, motors, and some channels combined
    with custom side plates. Take a look at this
    `computer-generated render <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1M8uj4QQUywU-_Y99aHIRolac_y93Jcq0>`_.
`NX VANTAGE-H <https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3d22333d5ba0abcc62edb57e/w/fa027f644666441544a378c6/e/693039a92658a00632996b28>`_
    Another custom drivetrain using goBILDA mecanum wheels, by redditor /u/nateless.
    Note that this design can be viewed but not downloaded - this is intentional;
    see his `original reddit post <https://www.reddit.com/r/FTC/comments/c8vlsj/cad_for_nx_vantageh_is_going_public/>`_.
