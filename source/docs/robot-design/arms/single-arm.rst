Single Arm
==========
The most simple type of arm in FTC,
a single arm refers to an arm on one axis of rotation.
While it is possible to successfully build this kind of arm,
generally a single axis arm will only afford around 15-16” of extension,
which is inadequate for nearly every game.
The reason for this is that the longest a channel can be is 18”
(technically you could have a longer channel by placing it diagonally,
but this complicates matters).
Thus, with a maximum of 18” of extension,
a couple inches must be subtracted,
since the point of rotation is inside the 18” sizing cube;
therefore the extension is around 15-16”.
Therefore, a single arm with further linear extension is optimal.
For example, some teams built a single arm with an added linear extension
mechanism to reach the desired extension length, which is generally >24”.

The advantages of a single arm are that it is relatively easy to build,
and can be a quick way to gain some form of extension outside of the robot
cube.

However, there are many disadvantages such as having a high gear ratio,
requiring much more support than a linear slide,
and being hard to control without the proper software.
