Know Your Lingo
===============

Many teams may be unfamiliar with the various terms and slang that are often thrown around at competitions and meets. Here we have compiled a guide of some commonly used terms to get you up to speed.

Competitions
------------

Program Delivery Partner (PDP)
   Director or directors for events and activities in a region. Used to be referred to as the Affiliate Partner (AP).
Qualifier
   Tournament with 5-6 qualifying matches and best-of-three alliance elimination matches. Judging included. Will advance to States/Regional level.
League Meet
   Low-stress tournament with matches counting towards league rank. No judging.
League Championship
   Tournament with ranked matches and alliance elimination matches. Judging included. Will advance to States/Regional level.
Alliance
   Group of two or, in eliminations, two or three teams that compete. In elimination matches each team must play at least once.
Ranking Points (RP)
   Primary basis in rankings. For the Ultimate Goal season, this is the sum of
   the scores that the alliances you are on at traditional events, and the sum
   of the scores that your team earns for remote events.
TieBreaker Points (TBP)
   Secondary determinant in team rankings. For the Ultimate Goal season, this
   is split up into two parts; TBP1 and TBP2. TBP1 is used before TBP2, and is
   the alliances/teams autonomous period score. TBP2 is the alliances/teams
   end game score. (Whether it is alliances/teams depends on if the team is at
   traditional events, respectively.)
Qualification Match
   Qualifying matches (generally 5) with random alliance partners and
   opponents will be played to determine team rankings.
Elimination Match
   4 alliances of 2 or 3 teams each compete in best of 3 matches to determine
