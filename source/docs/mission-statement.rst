Mission Statement
=================

Hello! Welcome and thank you for taking the time to read |gm0|, the premier resource for new and upcoming *FIRST*\ |reg| Tech Challenge teams! If you are a rookie or a new team, we would especially like to welcome you to the FTC\ |reg| community. We want to make your beginning steps and transition into FTC as seamless as possible, and offer some of our own experience and advice compiled over the years.

The goal of |gm0| is to create a comprehensive guide for FTC teams. Physical resources for FTC are few and far between, and online resources are scattered across the interwebs. Typically, the largest inhibitor for newer teams is the lack of knowledge base, as robotics is a relatively new STEM field. New teams also have not made connections to experienced teams who might mentor or offer advice throughout the season. Thus, they are left in the dark to figure things out, seemingly with no way out. While the journey of learning cannot be shortcut, |gm0| seeks to address these shortcomings by providing a starter's guide to the hardware and software in *FIRST* Tech Challenge.

When perusing this guide, it is important to keep in mind the authors' perspective. Many of the teams who contributed in the writing of this guide are veteran championship level teams in the upper echelon of FTC. **This means that most of our recommendations are almost solely from the competitive advantage standpoint.** For example, teams can learn a lot building a swerve drivetrain; but complex development challenges, space requirements, and often poor-to-mid performance means that we recommend that teams should only experiement with it as an off-season learning project. Just because there is a competitive advantage to one path does not automatically translate into a learning disadvantage for another. The guide has a plethora of useful information and knowledge (such as FTC and basic engineering principles) for all teams, including teams which are primarily trying to learn rather than compete. However, do take our recommendations with a grain of salt. We want to help all teams in FTC, but as our experience has been on the competitive side of the fence, certain parts of the guide may not be very applicable to some teams.

Furthermore, the guide was originally written with a specific audience in mind - young teams who have recently begun their journey in FTC. Our recommendations are generally geared towards more inexperienced teams. However, in the past couple years we have expanded the guide to provide more in-depth resources around more complex topics. In doing so, we hope that |gm0| will be a useful resource to rookie and veteran teams alike.

Before diving in, a short disclaimer: **this guide is not "How to Build a Championship-Winning Robot."** The purpose of |gm0| is simply to provide knowledge, advice, and tips on how to get started.

.. note:: It is of the utmost importance that all teams learn the proper way (by following the engineering design process), not by reading a step-by-step guide or instruction manual. Thus, while |gm0| has plenty of advice, we do not have specific steps included. Good luck, and have fun in FTC!
