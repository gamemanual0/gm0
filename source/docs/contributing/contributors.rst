============

|gm0| would not have been possible without the many contributors who have sacrificed their precious freetime (or merely found another excuse to procrastinate their work). I am especially grateful to Ben and Abi for helping port over |gm0| to Copperforge, and for all those who have continued to add and revise |gm0| during the busy school year. |gm0| had been my dream for quite some time, and as an alum tremendously grateful for all that *FIRST*\ |reg| has taught me, I wanted to create |gm0| to preserve and spread the knowledge base that might have been lost with the FTC\ |reg| class of 2019 and beyond. For this reason, I wanted to recognize all the contributors who have helped to make |gm0| a great resource for *FIRST* Tech Challenge teams. Feel free to contact any of the names listed below via the email (gamemanual0@gmail.com) or through the other contact emails - I'm sure that they would be more than willing to help you out!
