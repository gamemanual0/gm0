Advancing Awards
================

There are 7 awards for FTC teams (excluding optional awards).
In order of advancement priority, these are:

Inspire Award
-------------

The Inspire award is the top award for an FTC team.
It’s given to a team that consistently rises to the top in other awards
categories.
It’s also the top line on the advancement list,
and the winner is guaranteed to advance to the next level in most scenarios
if there is a next level,
unlike the winning alliance captain in some states.
In order to win the Inspire award,
your team should focus on every other award category,
and perform well in the robot game.
In the past the inspire award has given much more weight to awards
performance, but it seems as if the judges are now taking robot performance
into consideration more.
The Inspire award comes with focusing on everything else.
Of all the awards, this one is arguably the most subjective,
as it is about how good does a team does overall,
including and how much they weight outreach as compared to robot
performance along with documentation.

Official Game Manual Description
    This judged award is given to the team that best embodies the
    ‘challenge’ of the FIRST Tech Challenge program.
    The Team that receives this award is a strong ambassador for FIRST
    programs and a role model FIRST Team.
    This Team is a top contender for many other judged awards and is a
    gracious competitor.
    The Inspire Award winner is an inspiration to other Teams, acting with
    Gracious Professionalism® both on and off the playing field.
    This Team shares their experiences, enthusiasm and knowledge with other
    teams, sponsors, their community, and the Judges.
    Working as a unit, this Team will have shown success in performing the
    task of designing and building a Robot.

Think Award
-----------

The Think award is based entirely on the |EN|.
In order to have a chance at winning, should include as much math and
physics as possible in the |EN|,
and document the entire journey of the robot.
For the Think award,
it’s required to have a summary page in the Engineering Notebook,
with many page references.

Official Game Manual Description
    This judged award is given to the Team that best reflects the journey
    the Team took as they experienced the engineering design process during
    the build season.
    The engineering content within the notebook is the key reference for
    Judges to help identify the most deserving Team.
    The Team’s engineering content must focus on the design and build stage
    of the Team’s Robot.
    Journal entries should include descriptions of the underlying science
    and mathematics of the Robot design and game strategies, the designs,
    redesigns, successes, and opportunities for improvement.
    A Team is not a candidate for this award if their notebook does not
    include engineering content.

Connect Award
-------------

The Connect Award is one of the two outreach awards.
This award is for teams that work with their local STEM community and
corporate community.
Unfortunately, the line between the connect award and motivate award can be
vague, and most judges don’t know how to differentiate which outreach falls
under which award.
Look at the section about differentiating connect and motivate for more advice
on this.
For both outreach awards, a Team Plan is required.
Refer to the section about writing a team plan for advice.

Official Game Manual Description
    This judged award is given to the Team that most connects with their
    local science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) community.
    A true FIRST team is more than a sum of its parts and recognizes that
    engaging their local STEM community plays an essential part in their
    success.
    The recipient of this award is recognized for helping the community
    understand FIRST, the FIRST Tech Challenge, and the Team itself.
    The Team that wins the Connect Award aggressively seeks and recruits
    engineers and explores the opportunities available in the world of
    engineering, science and technology.
    This Team has a clear Team plan and has identified steps to achieve
    their goals.

Innovate Award
--------------

The Innovate award is just like what it sounds like -
it’s for teams with innovative parts to their robot or the robot as a
whole.
The Innovate award is for hardware mainly,
but some teams have been able to also present software as innovative.
Some judges think it’s great for presenting software as part of innovation,
but others feel that software only fits under control.

Official Game Manual Description
    The Collins Aerospace Innovate Award celebrates a Team that thinks
    outside the box and has the ingenuity, creativity and inventiveness to
    make their designs come to life.
    This judged award is given to the Team that has the most innovative and
    creative Robot design solution to any specific components in the
    FIRST Tech Challenge game.
    Elements of this award include elegant design, robustness,
    and ”out of the box” thinking related to design.
    This award may address the design of the whole Robot or of a
    sub-assembly attached to the Robot.
    The creative component must work consistently,
    but a Robot does not have to work all the time during Matches to be
    considered for this award.
    The Team’s engineering notebook must include journal entries to show
    the design of the component or components and the Team’s Robot to be
    eligible for this award.
    Entries must describe how the Team arrived at their solution.

Be aware that even though the awards description says “out of the box” and
therefore the emcee at your event will say that,
FTC Team 7244 is not guaranteed the Innovate award.

For presenting for this award, do your best to sell a few innovative parts,
and be prepared to choose the most innovative part of your robot,
as that is a common question judges ask.

Design Award
------------

The Design award is one of the robot awards for mainly the hardware of the
robot.
It is for robots that are both functional, aesthetic,
and use good design practices, including CAD.
For winning the Design award, it’s recommended your team uses CAD and
designs the robot before it is built,
with engineering notebook entries about the development of the robot.
While functionality is what most teams focus on,
the Design award also takes into account aesthetic,
and most judges will generally be turned off by an ugly robot for this
award (no cardboard on the robot!),
so make sure your robot looks presentable.

Official Game Manual Description
    This judged award recognizes design elements of the Robot that are both
    functional and aesthetic.
    The Design Award is presented to Teams that incorporate industrial
    design elements into their solution.
    These design elements could simplify the Robot’s appearance by giving
    it a clean look, be decorative in nature, or otherwise express the
    creativity of the Team.
    The Robot should be durable, efficiently designed,
    and effectively address the game challenge.

Motivate Award
--------------

The Motivate Award is one of the two outreach awards.
It’s for teams that work with their local and FIRST community.
Unfortunately, the line between the connect award and motivate award can be
vague, and most judges don’t know how to differentiate which outreach falls
under which award.
Look at the section about differentiating connect and motivate for more
advice on this.
For both outreach awards, a Team Plan is required.
Refer to the section about writing a team plan for advice.

Official Game Manual Description
    This Team embraces the culture of FIRST and clearly shows what it means
    to be a team.
    This judged award celebrates the Team that represents the essence of
    the FIRST Tech Challenge competition through Gracious Professionalism
    and general enthusiasm for the overall philosophy of FIRST and what it
    means to be a FIRST Tech Challenge Team.
    This is a Team who makes a collective effort to make FIRST known
    throughout their school and community,
    and sparks others to embrace the culture of FIRST.

Control Award
-------------

The Control award is meant to recognize a team that has a good software
solution to make their robot intelligent.
It’s known as the “software award” and is for the team with thebest/most
original/most innovative software and sensor solution for the game.
Don’t be tempted to overlook the control award even though it doesn’t
advance at most competitions, as every award performance counts towards the
Inspire award. Below is the official description in |gm1|.
This award requires a separate submission sheet which is a condensed
summary of a team’s software.

Official Game Manual Description
    The Control Award celebrates a Team that uses sensors and software to
    increase the Robot’s functionality in the field.
    This award is given to the Team that demonstrates innovative thinking
    to solve game challenges such as autonomous operation,
    improving mechanical systems with intelligent control,
    or using sensors to achieve better results.
    The control component should work consistently in the field.
    The Team’s engineering notebook must contain details about the
    implementation of the software, sensors, and mechanical control,
    but does not need to include copies of the code itself.

For winning this award,
teams are recommended to work on making their robots intelligent.
The control award doesn’t just focus on autonomous though,
and extends into the driver controlled period.
Many top teams for the Control award have presented not only the autonomous
period,but also features that help the drivers during the
driver controlled period.
For the Control award, don’t put code in your engineering notebook entries,
but rather an explanation of the math and algorithms used for your code.
Many judges are going to have a harder time reading and interpreting code
rather than explanations.
If you want to, put all of your latest code in an appendix in your
Engineering Notebook.

For pit judging,
you will usually be able to tell if a judge is trying to learn about the
control features of your robot due to the more specific questions asked.
Present your control points in an easy-to-understand way
(sometimes it may be helpful to teach it to someone who isn’t a programmer,
as they might be able to present it in a simpler manner),
but remember to use the correct names as is used throughout the rest of
your Engineering Notebook and Control Award Sheet,
so judges can find more information in your Engineering Notebook.

For your control award sheet,
you don’t have to stick to the official FIRST Template,
even though FIRST has never explicitly ruled so.
Many top-level teams that have won or placed for the control award at the
world championship do not use the FIRST Template provided in |gm1|.

Some examples of control award sheets are

Connect vs Motivate
-------------------

Both outreach awards can be hard to differentiate,
as the official descriptions are super vague,
and most judges don’t know the difference perfectly.
Since the descriptions are very vague,
it is up to you to determine what goes towards which award.
Oftentimes, teams will put more outreach in Connect than Motivate,
as Connect is fairly high up on the advancement list unlike Motivate,
so putting more into Connect and winning Connect may advance,
though make sure to do your research before trying a strategy like this.

What Falls Under Connect?

* Developing relationships with companies
* Getting external mentors (not parents)
* Fundraising from companies
  (other methods may fall under motivate on a case by case basis)

What Falls Under Motivate?

* Starting/Mentoring FIRST Teams
* Community Demos

Tips for Both

* Present numbers, but only emphasize them if they’re large with a wow factor
* Present stories to the judges, not just overviews.
  Tell personal stories
* Log all your outreach events,
  with who went and how many hours each person did in its own place separate
  from the engineering notebook.
  This makes it easier to compile total numbers and shows the judges every
  outreach activity/event in one place

Optional Awards
===============

There are some awards that events are not required to present;
these do not advance teams.

Judges Award
------------

The Judges award is meant to recognize a team that doesn’t fit into any of
the existing award categories,
but the judges still felt the team deserved to win an award for their
outstanding effort or other experience.
This award is very subjective, and doesn’t advance teams.
It is also optional to give at every competition,
but in some regions given at every competition unless the judges don’t find
a deserving team.

Promote Award and Compass Award
-------------------------------

The Promote and Compass awards are optional awards which are usually given
only at state championships and world championships.
These awards do not require an engineering notebook to win,
but do not advance teams.
They are submitted as a video no longer than 1 minute.
The Promote award is for creating a PSA for FIRST with a specific video
prompt.
This prompt changes every year, and is found in |gm1|.
The Compass award is for recognizing an outstanding mentor.
Submitting these awards is usually done on a case-by-case basis,
where the event organizer sends teams instructions on how to submit.

Some good Promote award submissions include:

* `Team 3595 in 2014 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYFxuJwtCu0>`_
* `Team 8808 in 2017 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yjGMYbtKU0>`_
* `Team 5795 in 2017 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gn-URpmXVA>`_
* `Team 4924 in 2016 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaKEnutiR4>`_

Some good Compass award submissions include:

* `Team 4855 in 2017 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3zK2l7K8Fo>`_
