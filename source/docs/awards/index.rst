Awards

This is the part of |gm0| that discusses awards.
Awards exist in parallel to the robot game and serves as an alternate way to
advance.
While the majority of |gm0| talks about how to make decisions about creating
your robot,
the notebook you write is actually showing how you made those decisions.
It only benefits you to go for awards.
You can't win awards without writing a notebook,
and in certain states the only way to advance is awards and in others it can
make it significantly easier to advance.
Therefore, these are the topics that will be covered in this section of |gm0|.

.. warning::
    Judging and awards are extremely subjective and some rules change a bit
    from state to state.
    What works in one region may not in other regions.
    So contact your judges about specifics of some things;
    for example some competitions allow you to turn a custom control award
    sheet, others only accept the one listed by FIRST.
    The writers of this part of |gm0| have extensive experience with awards and
    have even been winners and finalists for the inspire award at the World
    Championship.

For most awards, teams have a 5 minute presentation at the beginning of the day
followed by some Q&A time and possibly pit judging later on
(read the section on the judging process for more detail).
There are 7 awards for FTC teams (excluding awards that cannot advance a team).

For winning every award, the Engineering Notebook is a key reference and is
quintessential, so make sure that your team focuses on the Engineering
Notebook.

Always remember that regardless of how well you feel you did,
awards have a level of subjectivity of the judges,
so there is no way to 100% control how your team does for awards.

Overall,
awards are one of the core parts of the FIRST Tech Challenge competition.
They recognize teams at the end of every competition (except league meets)
as well as determine many of the teams that advance.
