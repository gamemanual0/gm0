Custom
======
Many teams elect to ignore kits entirely and instead make their own mechanisms
completely from scratch.
While this allows for nearly unlimited design freedom,
keep in mind *full* Custom has many caveats and drawbacks.
A full CAD model is required for a custom robot, as well as machining
capability.
Custom robots are not suitable for a new team.

However, forgoing a full custom robot opens up many opportunities.
Many teams choose to create a robot that is a mix of kit
parts and custom parts.
Our recommendation is to use kit parts as the backbone of the robot, and custom
fabricate any additional parts necessary, instead of the other way around.
That way, you can rely on the strength and durability of the kit while
retaining the ability to customize small pieces and mechanisms to your
advantage.

In discussing custom options for teams, the two primary categories are as
follows:

    :maxdepth: 1

    3d-printing
    machining
