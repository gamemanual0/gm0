   Disconnect
      A disconnect (DC) is when, for any reason, the robot is not able to be controlled from the gamepad. This can happen for many reasons - static buildup on the robot, a loose cable, or an error in code.

      Generally, most DCs are caused by improper wiring, so wire stress relief is encouraged for all teams (:term:`USB Retention Mount`). They can also be caused by Wi-Fi disconnects, or an ESD (electrostatic discharge) shock to the electronics.

   Driver Station
      The Driver Station (DS) refers to both the software and device that is used by the drive team and connects to the gamepad(s). The device can either be one of the Android phones specified in the |cm| or a REV Robotics Driver Hub.

   Robot Controller
      The Robot Controller (RC) refers to both the software and device that is on the robot that controls it. This can either be a REV Robotics Control Hub or one of the Android phones specified in the |cm| connected to an Expansion Hub via a Micro USB cable.
