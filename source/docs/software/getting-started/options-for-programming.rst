Options for Programming
=======================

There are three recommended options for teams to use when programming a robot to do various tasks: Blocks, OnBot Java, and Android Studio.

Blocks
------

The Blocks Programming Tool is a visual programming language (similar to tools like Scratch) which provides a simple way to code simple actions for the robot. It has a colorful and LEGO\ |reg| like design (including sounds of block pieces of snapping together), making the system very accessible to those new to the world of programming.

Using a device and a robot controller phone, connect your device to the phone's Wi-Fi by clicking the three dots in the top right of the :term:`RC <Robot Controller>` and select "Program & Manage". This will display the Wi-Fi SSID and password for you to connect to. Go to your browser and enter the address shown on the :term:`RC <Robot Controller>`.

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- Good for beginners: one of the easiest and simplest options to use
- Easy to set up: requires a device (laptop, chromebook, tablet) and a phone in the Program & Manage screen
- Programs can be saved directly to the :term:`RC <Robot Controller>`

  - Changes can be made quickly
- Doesn't require an external Wi-Fi connection

Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Not recommended if you're already familiar with some type of programming

  - Primarily a teaching tool for people with no programming experience
- Using external libraries is impossible
- This will change your computer's Wi-Fi connection to the :term:`Robot Controller's <Robot Controller>` Wi-Fi network, and as such, you will be unable to access the internet while connected to this particular network.

  - Teams can get around this by purchasing an external Wi-Fi module that allows their computer to connect to 2 Wi-Fi networks at once.

- Sacrifices flexibility and application for simplicity
- Don't ever use it on a phone, unless you're out of options. (Not phone-friendly)

  - You may make a bigger mess if you try to.

OnBot Java
----------

OnBot Java uses a similar method of using a browser to code and save directly to the phone. The difference being that a programming language called Java is used instead.

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- Recommended if you're learning or have learned some programming, even better if you know a little Java.
- Greater flexibility than Blocks
- There are a lot more resources available in case you need help
- More applicable to the real-world than Blocks
- Maintains most of the advantages of Blocks

Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Steeper learning curve than Blocks
- The OnBotJava editor lacks a lot of features (e.g. autocomplete) that make working with a text-based programming language convenient
- Using external libraries is functionally impossible
- This will change your computer's Wi-Fi connection to the :term:`Robot Controller's <Robot Controller>` Wi-Fi network, and as such, you will be unable to access the internet while connected to this particular network.

  - Teams can get around this by purchasing an external Wi-Fi module that allows their computer to connect to 2 Wi-Fi networks at once.

Android Studio
--------------

Android Studio is a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that uses Java and/or Kotlin to program the phones. Instead of using a browser to upload code, Android Studio will compile your Robot Controller code into a .apk file (an app installer), and install that on the phone.

Advantages
^^^^^^^^^^

- Recommended if you're learning or have learned some programming, even better if you know a little Java.
- Much greater flexibility than Blocks.
- Full suite of modern IDE features (autocomplete, error highlighting, etc) that make working with a text-based programming language convenient
- Can use libraries like `Road Runner`_, `FTCLib`_, and `FTC Dashboard`_.
- Can use either a USB connection to the :term:`RC <Robot Controller>` phone, or a wireless connection to upload code.

  .. tip:: Deploy times can be sped up significantly by using `Sloth`_.

- Can debug in real-time
- Many resources for Java, Android Studio, and IntelliJ IDEA
- Can use programming languages besides Java (see `Other Programming Languages`_)

Disadvantages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Connecting to the robot controller's Wi-Fi network will prevent you from using anything on the internet including video tutorials and online communication, unless you have a second Wi-Fi adapter (cheap and easy)
- Relatively easy setup process, but time consuming and is a relatively hefty install (3GB of files between Android Studio, FtcRobotController, and other libraries)
- There are a number of oddities that can easily cause issues/confusion when first setting everything up. Reaching out to the community for assistance is recommended if you are having issues.

Other Programming Languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using Android Studio, it is possible to use languages besides Java.

Kotlin
~~~~~~

Kotlin is a relatively new and rapidly growing programming language from JetBrains, the creator of the IntelliJ IDE, which Android Studio is based on. Kotlin was made to be completely compatible with Java, while being easier to work with and supporting more modern language features. Google now considers it the primary language for Android application development, but Java is still supported.

Advantages
""""""""""

- Concise, readable, easy to edit code

  - Easy to write as it takes much less code to do the same thing
- Both optional type inference and a stronger type system than Java
- Null safety
- Thread safety
- Functional programming
- Seamless integration with Java code and libraries
- Very easy to transition from Java

Disadvantages
"""""""""""""

- Not widely used in FTC\ |reg| yet
- New and has fewer community resources for training
- Not recommended for programmers who need large amounts of help from other teams, unless those teams are experienced in Kotlin

C and C++
~~~~~~~~~

C and C++ are native programming languages compatible with Android. Very few teams have used C++. This is typically used for only part of the code, with the majority being Java or Kotlin.

Advantages
""""""""""

- Fast execution for extremely resource-intensive applications.
- Supports more libraries

Disadvantages
"""""""""""""

- Rarely needed
- Very difficult to set up
- Difficult to debug code
- Very few teams can help you
- Very few online resources
