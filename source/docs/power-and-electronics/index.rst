   Gauge
      Wire gauge refers to the diameter of wire. AWG stands for American Wire Gauge, the general system used in the US. The **larger** the gauge number, the **smaller** the wire diameter. Generally, :term:`servo <Servo>` wires are 22 AWG and motor wires are 18 AWG.

   Grounding Strap
      A grounding strap is used to ground the metal frame of the robot to the :term:`XT30` port of the Expansion Hub. It is the only legal way to ground your robot.

   USB Retention Mount
      The USB Retention Mount, sold by REV, is a plastic part affixed to the Expansion Hub that relieves stress on the USB Mini-B port. This is especially important because if the USB cable is loose or disconnected, the robot controller cannot communicate with the Expansion Hub, causing a disconnect.

      .. note:: For teams using an expansion hub plugged in via USB, it is highly recommended for teams to purchase the USB retention mount.
