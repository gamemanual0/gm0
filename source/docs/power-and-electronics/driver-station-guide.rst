Driver Station Guide 
====================

From many years of collective experience, the writers have accumulated some general recommendations and best practices 
for driver stations to reduce the risk of disconnects. 

*   A 5GHz phone is preferred over the standard 2.4GHz phone to reduce ping issues. Have you ever noticed that 
    your team's robot seems to lag at competitions only? Most teams run on 2.4GHz, which means that 
    the 2.4GHz channels will be more crowded on competition day. This can lead to noticeably higher ping/lag which adversely
    affects driver and robot performance. 
*   USB and OTG connections can be a possible source of disconnects during a match. This is generally caused by poor quality 
    connectors or adapters between the driver station and the gamepad controller. It generally is worth it to purchase 
    higher quality connectors as opposed to the cheapest options.

*   The Xbox 360 controller is preferred by many top teams over the standard Logitech game controller. This is mostly 
    as the Xbox controller has less of a dead spot. A dead spot is basically the area where the joystick can move but not 
    communicate that the stick has shifted slightly. This means that when the joystick is moved to a position where the controller 
    can detect it, the robot will sometimes have a tendency to lurch forward. Dead spots make it difficult for the driver to 
    execute fine-tuned and precise movements. The Logitech controller has a considerably larger dead spot area, so the Xbox controller 
    is preferred. However, this is likely a non-issue for the large majority of teams. Also, keep in mind that there are very 
    specific models of the Xbox controller that are legal, so they can be hard to find new.
*   A phone holder and OTG strain relief connector can be useful as it may help to prevent connections from loosening. Especially if teams 
    are running dual controller configuration, ensuring that the USB hub is secure won't hurt.
