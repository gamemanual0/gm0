   Core Hex Motor
      The Core Hex Motor, sold by REV, is different from the standard :term:`RS-555 series motors <RS-550 Series Motor>` that are generally used by FTC\ |reg| teams. It features a 90 degree orientation and does not contain an output shaft. Thus, teams will have to cut 5 mm hex shaft to length as needed. The Core Hex motor has a slow gear ratio (72:1), and is not as powerful as the RS-555 series motor.

      .. warning:: We advise teams to go against the Basic Bot Guide provided by *FIRST*\ |reg|, as Core Hex Motors should NOT be used to power drivetrains.

   UltraHex
      UltraHex is 1/2" aluminum hex :term:`shafting <Shaft>` sold by REV Robotics. There is an inner 5 mm hex :term:`bore <Bore>` in the middle, which allows compatibility with REV's 5 mm hex shaft motion system. The 5mm hex bore also allows for a 1/4-20 or M6 screw to be tapped into it. 1/2" hex is also compatible with many FRC\ |reg| vendors.
