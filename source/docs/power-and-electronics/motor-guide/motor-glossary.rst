   Core Hex Motor
      The Core Hex Motor, sold by REV, is different from the standard :term:`RS-555 series motors <RS-550 Series Motor>` that are generally used by FTC\ |reg| teams. It features a 90 degree orientation and does not contain an output shaft. Thus, teams will have to cut 5 mm hex shaft to length as needed. The Core Hex motor has a slow gear ratio (72:1), and is much less powerful than the RS-555 series motors.

      .. warning:: We advise teams to go against the Basic Bot Guide provided by *FIRST*\ |reg|, as Core Hex Motors should NOT be used to power drivetrains.

   NeveRest Motor
      The NeveRest Motor, sold by AndyMark, is a :term:`RS-555 series motor <RS-550 Series Motor>` that is available in spur gear and planetary options. It has a 6 mm D-shaft output.

   Yellow Jacket Motor
      Yellow Jacket motors are the :term:`RS-555 series motor <RS-550 Series Motor>` and :term:`planetary gearbox <Planetary Gear>` sold by goBILDA. They come with a 6 mm D-shaft (5202 series) or 8 mm REX shaft (5203/5204 series) and are available in many different :term:`gear ratios <Gear Reduction>` from 3.7:1 up to 188:1.

   UltraHex
      UltraHex is 1/2" aluminum hex :term:`shafting <Shaft>` sold by REV Robotics. There is an inner 5 mm hex :term:`bore <Bore>` in the middle, which allows compatibility with REV's 5 mm hex shaft motion system. The 5mm hex bore also allows for a 1/4-20 or M6 screw to be tapped into it. 1/2" hex is also compatible with many FRC\ |reg| vendors.

   RS-550 Series Motor
      The RS-555 series motor is the standard motor in FTC. It forms the base for the :term:`AndyMark NeveRest <NeveRest Motor>`, :term:`REV HD Hex <HD Hex Motor>`, and :term:`goBILDA Yellow Jacket <Yellow Jacket Motor>` motors.
