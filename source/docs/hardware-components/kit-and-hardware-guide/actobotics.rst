Actobotics (Discontinued)
=========================

.. attention:: As of June 2023, ServoCity has `discontinued the Actobotics line <https://www.servocity.com/blog/farewell-to-actobotics/>`_ to focus on goBILDA. We are retaining these pages as historical reference for teams that continue to have and use Actobotics parts.

The Actobotics kit from ServoCity (https://www.servocity.com/actobotics) is a fixed-pitch, :term:`channel-based <Channel>` building system using imperial units. Its 1.5" :term:`c-channel <Channel>` and :term:`ball-bearing <Ball Bearing>` based motion system allows teams to iterate and build mechanisms entirely from kit parts.

Prior to being discontinued, Actobotics was a solid choice for new teams, offering a reliable base kit with many options to expand upon.  Because it is no longer being produced, we recommend teams consider other kits instead.

Special Considerations
----------------------

- Actobotics' :term:`channel <Channel>` hole pattern has many more mounting holes than a Tetrix channel, so it offers more flexibility in terms of mounting.
- Actobotics uses imperial units across the board, allowing for clean spacing and fitting. However, most other kits use metric.
- Actobotics can interface with other kits such as REV through a variety of Pattern Adapters.
- ServoCity offers a 25% off discount for all *FIRST*\ |reg| teams, making pricing competitive: https://www.servocity.com/first_team_discounts

Notable Components
------------------

- Mini-channel is offered in addition to the standard size :term:`channel <Channel>` for non-structural components.
- Actobotics' X-rail :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` system offers immense adjustability and flexibility as it adds a :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` component to a :term:`channel-based <Channel>` kit.
- To complement the structural offerings, Actobotics uses a series of clamping hubs and a robust 1/4" steel :term:`D-shaft <Shaft>`.
- The Linear Motion Kit uses X-rail :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` to build extending mechanisms.
- The :term:`Servoblocks`, which prolongs the life of a servo, are recommended for all teams, regardless of kit. However, :term:`Servoblocks` seamlessly interface with the Actobotics ecosystem.
- Actobotics furthermore offers motion options such as :term:`bevel gears <Bevel gear>` and Linear Actuator kits (using :term:`lead screws <Lead Screw>`) for specific use cases.

Advantages
----------

- Actobotics provides a great value fixed pitch build system that is generally easier to assemble than :term:`extrusion-based <Extrusion>` systems which require cutting :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>` to length.
- Actobotics has the patented :term:`Servoblocks`, which help drastically increase servo life by protecting it from shock loads. More information may be found in the glossary.
- Actobotics is easily compatible with other build systems such as REV's kit using adapters which can be found on the Servocity website.
- Actobotics is more sturdy than TETRIX in terms of drivetrain flex and has more support options to prevent structural bending.
- The :term:`clamping hubs <Clamping Hub>` offered are more reliable than :term:`set screws <Set Screw>`, as clamping engages the shaft in more places than a :term:`set screw <Set Screw>` (one face). As discussed in the :doc:`TETRIX section <tetrix>`, set screws in particular are vulnerable to loosening, especially without application of Loctite.
- Actobotics' motion system is **very** robust and relies on :term:`ball bearings <Ball Bearing>`, which have a lower coefficient of friction than bushings. Actobotics is compatible with the 5mm hex used by REV with their adaptable hubs.
- Actobotics also allows for :term:`face mounting <Face Mounting>` of motors as opposed to :term:`clamp mounting <Clamp Mounting>`.

Disadvantages
-------------

- Actobotics is no longer being produced by ServoCity, so it may be difficult to locate some parts.
- Actobotics is not very cheap, so its cost may be prohibitive for some teams with a low budget. Note that with the 25% off FTC\ |reg| team discount, Actobotics can be cheaper than TETRIX. The only cheaper build system is REV.
- The XL :term:`belts <Timing Belt>` from ServoCity are not great. It is recommended that :term:`belts <HTD Belt>` are purchased from ServoCity instead, which may necessitate the use of 3D printed pulleys. There also isn't a large amount of space inside the channel for a belt or chain run, vastly limiting the size of the pulleys.
- :term:`Channel` takes up more space than :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>`, so mechanisms can be a bit larger with the Actobotics kit. To remediate this issue, ServoCity sells :term:`mini-channel <Channel>` which is a similar size as :term:`extrusion <Extrusion>`.
