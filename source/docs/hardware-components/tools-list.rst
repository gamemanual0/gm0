Tools List
==========

Here are a selection of necessary and useful tools for your team. You'll obviously need to purchase the basics such as the right screwdriver, hex keys, and drill bits. For a bit more precision and the ability to dabble in custom, opt for a drill press and bandsaw. A router might be useful for teams interested in working with wood, a great material for prototyping (and also for final iterations!)

Necessary
---------

- **Safety glasses. Wear them when you're using power tools. Seriously.**
- Philips screwdrivers, assorted sizes
- Hex drivers and hex L-keys
   - 7/64" hex (Actobotics and TETRIX)
   - 3/32", ball head for set screws is discouraged (TETRIX)
   - 2.5/3mm hex (goBILDA)
- Nut drivers and wrenches
   - 5.5 mm hex nut driver/wrench (REV)
   - 7 mm hex nut driver/wrench (goBILDA)
- Drill and drill bits
- Pliers, needle-nose and locking
- Metal file (sandpaper not recommended, you're not working with wood)
- Quick lock clamps (2+) or vise
- Hammer and mallet
- Centerpunch
- Hacksaw (cuts through steel shafts)
- Wire stripper/wire cutter
- Zip ties/Velcro ties
- Electrical tape
- Stainless steel ruler and rafter square
- Sharp pencil or very fine permanent marker

Helpful
-------

- Bandsaw

  .. caution:: A bandsaw **cannot** cut through steel :term:`shafts <Shaft>`!

- Impact driver
- Drill press
- Miter saw with non-ferrous metal cutting blade
- Dremel (use sparingly; Dremel =/= bandsaw)
- Grip tape
- Caliper
- Soldering iron
- Heat gun
- Router or table saw
- Jigsaw
- Metal brake
- 3d printer

A 3d printer, CNC machine, or laser cutter greatly increases your ability to create custom robot designs. For most teams, buying a CNC or laser cutter is way beyond their budget, but you might be able to get access to one through school, local college, or nearby makerspace.
